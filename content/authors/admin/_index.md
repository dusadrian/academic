I work at the [Department of Sociology](http://www.sas.unibuc.ro) of the [University of Bucharest](http://www.unibuc.ro), teaching social statistics, research methodology and measurement in the social sciences.

I am also the National Coordinator of the [ESS - European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org), and Director of the [RODA - Romanian Social Data Archive](http://www.roda.ro), being involved in data archiving for more than 20 years in partnership with the [CESSDA - Council of European Social Science Data Archives](https://www.cessda.eu).

My activity in the domain of research infrastructures was acknowledged both nationally, appointed as a member of the CRIC - Romanian Committee for Research Infrastructures, and internationally as a former Romanian delegate to [ESFRI - European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures](http://www.esfri.eu/), where I chaired the SCI-SWG - Social and Cultural Innovation Strategy Working Group between 2012 and 2014.

My primary research interest is QCA - Qualitative Comparative Analysis, a novel methodology for social research that inspires a growing community for which I serve as a member of the Advisory Board and Steering Committee at [COMPASSS](http://www.compasss.org). I have published extensively on methodological aspects, with a key interest in the programming of the minimization algorithms. My main programming environment is [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (see also [R-omania](http://www.r-project.ro/)), for which I have contributed a number of packages, among which [QCA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QCA/index.html) for running Qualitative Comparative Analysis, [DDIwR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DDIwR/index.html) to convert to and from other statistical software, and [declared](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/declared/index.html) for (finally) declaring missing values and labels in R.

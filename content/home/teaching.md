At the Department of Sociology, I teach the following classes:

- [Descriptive Statistics](http://193.231.1.6/course/view.php?id=123)
- [Inferential Statistics](http://193.231.1.6/course/view.php?id=5)
- Measurement in the social sciences

My prefered e-learning platform is Moodle, where students complete quizzes and build their final grade throughout the entire semester.

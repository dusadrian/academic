# Biography
I work at the [Department of Sociology](http://www.sas.unibuc.ro) of the [University of Bucharest](http://www.unibuc.ro), teaching social statistics, research methodology and measurement in the social sciences. I am also the Director of the [RODA - Romanian Social Data Archive](http://www.roda.ro), being involved in data archiving for almost 20 years, in partnership with the [CESSDA - Council of European Social Science Data Archives](https://www.cessda.eu).

With a joint proposal for CESSDA and [ESS - European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org), two of the most important landmark projects for the social sciences in the European lanscape at [ESFRI - European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures](http://www.esfri.eu/), RODA is about to become a National Research Infrastructure for the social sciences, already included in the [National Roadmap for Research Infrastructures](http://www.poc.research.gov.ro/uploads/despre-oicercetare/documente-de-programare/2017/cric-raport-final-22-11-2017.pdf), recently published by the Ministry of Research and Innovation. My activity in the research infrastructures area was acknowledged both nationally, appointed as a member of the CRIC - Romanian Committee for Research Infrastructures, and internationally as a Romanian delegate to ESFRI, where I chaired the SCI-SWG - Social and Cultural Innovation Strategy Working Group between 2012 and 2014.

My primary research interest is QCA - Qualitative Comparative Analysis, a novel methodology for social research that inspires a growing community for which I serve as a member of the Advisory Board and Steering Committee at [COMPASSS](http://www.compasss.org). I have published extensively on methodological aspects, with a key interest in the programming of the minimization algorithms. My main programming environment is [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (see also [R-omania](http://www.r-project.ro/)), for which I have contributed a number of packages, among which a highly advanced and sophisticated [QCA software](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QCA/index.html). It includes a cross-platform, web-based Graphical User Interface written with a custom combination of HTML, Javascript, jQuery, a special SVG library called [Raph√§el](http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/) and one the most spectacular packages called [**shiny**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html) to link everything with the base R.

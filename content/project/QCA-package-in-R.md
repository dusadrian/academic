This project started in 2007, while visiting the COMPASSS center at [Universit√© Catholique de Louvain](http://www.compasss.org).

I was then doing my PhD in comparative analysis, and thought it was a good idea to learn both R and QCA by programming the Boolean minimization algorithm. Over the years, the package grew larger and larger in functionality and it is now one of the best QCA software in the world.

The package is published on the [CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QCA/index.html).

From version 2.0 onwards, the package also has a graphical user interface written with the **shiny** package in R and a custom combination of Javascript and SVG. Since it is opened in a web page, it is cross-platform. In principle, it should also be cross-browser although it has only been tested in Chrome.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A book concerning the challenges and future advancements of European research infrastructures for the humanities and social sciences, relevant for the funding schemes of the Commission&amp;rsquo;s Framework Programs and for the ESRFI Roadmap update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 20 articles experts from research, politics and research management discuss current challenges and future advancements of European research infrastructures for the humanities and social sciences, particularly in view of the funding scheme Horizon 2020 and the ESRFI Roadmap update. Starting with an overview of SSH infrastructures it elaborates on four specific areas that increasingly demand a pan-European approach. Drawing from the SSH infrastructure projects&amp;rsquo; experience, it then (re-) defines the requirements and potential for next generation infrastructure projects. They highlight the developments and problems they anticipate, focussing in particular on advancing digitalisation in the SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book draws together the insights gained at a conference of the same name, &amp;ldquo;Facing the Future&amp;rdquo;, held in Berlin in November 2013. The conference was attended by 70 experts from 19 European countries who met to discuss the new challenges posed by the increasing necessity of integrating digital research tools into everyday working life. It was organised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), the federation of All European Academies (ALLEA), the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities, and the German Data Forum. It took place as part of a project financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) entitled Survey and Analysis of Basic Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities in Europe (SASSH).&lt;/p&gt;

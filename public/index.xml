      <title>The QCA package in R</title>
      <link>https://adriandusa.eu/project/qca-package-in-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://adriandusa.eu/project/qca-package-in-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project started in 2007, while visiting the COMPASSS center at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.compasss.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Université Catholique de Louvain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was then doing my PhD in comparative analysis, and thought it was a good idea to learn both R and QCA by programming the Boolean minimization algorithm. Over the years, the package grew larger and larger in functionality and it is now one of the best QCA software in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package is published on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QCA/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CRAN repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From version 2.0 onwards, the package also has a graphical user interface written with the &lt;strong&gt;shiny&lt;/strong&gt; package in R and a custom combination of Javascript and SVG. Since it is opened in a web page, it is cross-platform. In principle, it should also be cross-browser although it has only been tested in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating this personal blogsite using R</title>
      <link>https://adriandusa.eu/2018/02/12/first-post/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://adriandusa.eu/2018/02/12/first-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating a personal webpage was a long overdue item on my list. Some years ago I tried a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sites.google.com/site/dusadrian/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google hosted site&lt;/a&gt; which was good enough at the time, but never got to update it since it was just too tedious to work with the low level HTML code. In addition, it missed all the nice features of the modern web: a responsive page to render on desktops, tablets  and mobile phones, sharing a post, commenting on it, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for various alternatives ever since, but not completely convinced by any one. Until a few months ago, when Yihui Xie announced the creation of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package in R, designed specifically to create a website (or a blog) in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic, I thought. And the result is truly spectacular, thanks to the close interlink between this R package (I use it with RStudio), and some other frameworks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; (the workhorse behind the automatic creation of the website itself), &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; (a lightweight but powerful markup language that complements $\rm \LaTeX$, for the geeks among us) and a Hugo theme called &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Academic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those are pretty automatic and do not require a highly sophisticated level of computer literacy. There are numerous step by step tutorials, starting with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;complete book&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt; package (the book itself being written with another amazing R package by Yihui Xie called &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bookdown/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bookdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and Googling around I found Alison Hill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to with blogdown&lt;/a&gt; that further points to three other tutorials, as well as this &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;very useful documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not not about duplicating the information from those tutorials (those links should be enough to get you going), I just wanted to spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A webpage of any kind needs a server to host it. Thankfully, reading all those tutorials I learned about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, an amazing free webhosting platform with tons of automatic features that makes my life a lot easier. For those with a basic computer knowledge about HTML and what a webpage is, having a website hosted by Netlify is as easy as creating one (using their highly intuitive menus), then simply dragging the public directory (generated for instance with the &lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt; package in RStudio) of the website, on the dedicated area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Netlify can be of a much more help. Instead of building the website locally, it is a whole lot easier to host the Markdown files that generate it on a GitHub repository such as mine &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dusadrian/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, something like GitHub required a little bit more about computers and programming, but there are tons of tutorials out there as well. It also involves a versioning system like &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; (which, if I am not mistaken, was created by none other than Linus Torvalds, the father of Linux).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining git (natively supported by RStudio) and GitHub can be life saving. I found myself hopelessly looking at the Markdown files, not knowing what I did wrong, to find grace in reverting to a previously working version. And Netlify is very happy to work with a GitHub repository and re-deploys the website with any change in the GitHub repo. It is now as simple as creating a Markdown text file (there are templates for publications, posts, projects, talks etc.), commit and push to GitHub&amp;hellip; and enjoy the benefits of the automatic deployment on Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all, the Netlify deployment system logs every possible problem and tells you why the deployment failed (something that RStudio doesn&amp;rsquo;t do yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more fine tuning was needed to add comments to posts. Hugo is happy to work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, another highly intuitive framework that I like, and readers are welcomed to authenticate themselves with a multitude of choices (Gmail, Facebook etc.) in order to post comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the icing on the cake, for those aware it is also possible to allocate a Google Analytics ID to track how many hits the website attracted, how many reads and so on. All of those, in a matter of about two days of effort, but it is well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Consistency Cubes. A Fast, Efficient Method for exact Boolean Minimization</title>
      <link>https://adriandusa.eu/publication/ccubes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main idea of this paper is to find prime implicants from bottom-up, instead of top-down as in the classical Quine-McCluskey algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to shorten the execution time, the search space (the implicant matrix) is partitioned in succesive layers of complexity, given the following equality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\prod_{c = 1}^{k} (l_c + 1) = 1 + \sum_{c = 1}^{k}\binom{k}{c}\prod_{s = 1}^{c} l_s$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left hand side of this equation represents the entire implicant matrix (including the original, observed truth table configurations) and the right hand side is the same space partitioned in layers of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elemente de analiză comparativă</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$~$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elemente de analiză comparativă face o prezentare a unui domeniu metodologic bogat, care a cunoscut o explozie de interes în ultimii 25 de ani. Dezvoltată cu precărede în sociologie şi ştiinţele politice, analiza calitativ comparativă poate fi aplicată cu succes în orice domeniu de cercetare socială prin utilizarea unui algoritm de minimizare booleană, rezultatul fiind o combinaţie cauzală minimă care este asociată cu producerea unui fenomen de interes. Cartea se doreşte a fi o introducere lejeră în această metodologie de cercetare, cu toate punctele tari dar şi cu criticile asociate. Primul capitol analizează diferenţele dintre calitativ şi cantitativ în ştiinţele sociale, iar următoarele două capitole arată cum analiza comparativă reuşeşte să medieze cele două lumi. Al patrulea capitol reia noţiuni de teoria mulţimilor, iar capitolul final descrie metodologia de analiză calitativ comparativă, în special dezvoltarea modernă a acesteia cu ajutorul mulţimilor vagi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$~$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 20 articles experts from research, politics and research management discuss current challenges and future advancements of European research infrastructures for the humanities and social sciences, particularly in view of the funding scheme Horizon 2020 and the ESRFI Roadmap update. Starting with an overview of SSH infrastructures it elaborates on four specific areas that increasingly demand a pan-European approach. Drawing from the SSH infrastructure projects&amp;rsquo; experience, it then (re-) defines the requirements and potential for next generation infrastructure projects. They highlight the developments and problems they anticipate, focussing in particular on advancing digitalisation in the SSH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book draws together the insights gained at a conference of the same name, “Facing the Future”, held in Berlin in November 2013. The conference was attended by 70 experts from 19 European countries who met to discuss the new challenges posed by the increasing necessity of integrating digital research tools into everyday working life. It was organised by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), the federation of All European Academies (ALLEA), the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities, and the German Data Forum. It took place as part of a project financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) entitled Survey and Analysis of Basic Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities in Europe (SASSH).&lt;/p&gt;
